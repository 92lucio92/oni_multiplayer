[h1] Welcome to the Oxygen Not Included Multiplayer Mod! [/h1]
With this mod, all players share controls over a single colony. You and your friends work together to make decisions collectively. Both of you controls all duplicants and assign tasks to them. However players are not coupled to the same view, each player can look and control differents parts of the world, while actions will be synced.
